##This Series
1. Part One - Your First Endpoint
2. Part Two - Updating your API
3. Part Three - Securing your API - API Keys
4. Part Four - oAuth based API Access
5. Part Five - Sharing your API with other Users

If you are interested in jumping directly to a future tutorial, the following tutorials are included in this series. Please note, while the tutorials are designed to build upon one another in a linear fashion, all required materials are provided with each seperate tutorial, allowing you should be able to dive straight in if you are interested in a particular topic.

##Part One - Hello Endpoints

###Goal of Tutorial
**Build, deploy, and test a simple 'hello world' API using Python, Flask, Google Container Engine and Google Cloud Endpoints.**

Our backend will be a simple Python + Flask application. The application will be run using Google Container Enigne. We will use Google Cloud Endpoints for its API management capabilities (which we will gradually add over the course of future tutorials).

Our API will have two methods: 
1. 'hello' which will return the text 'Hello Endpoints'.
2. 'reverse' which will take a given string and reverse it. 

###Assumptions
This tutorial is designed to get you up and running with your first Google Cloud Endpoints API. Thus, while we will try to go slowly through each and every stage in the process, this is not a general Google Cloud Platform (GCP) or Google Container Enginer (GKE) tutorial. If you need help getting set up with GCP, please read the official getting started guides.
