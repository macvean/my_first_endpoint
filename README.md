# Manage your API with Google Cloud Endpoints - Python & GKE

##Welcome

##This Series

##Part One - Hello Endpoints

###Goal of Tutorial
**Build, deploy, and test a simple 'hello world' API using Python, Flask, Google Container Engine and Google Cloud Endpoints.**

Our backend will be a simple Python + Flask application. The application will be run using Google Container Enigne. We will use Google Cloud Endpoints for its API management capabilities (which we will gradually add over the course of future tutorials).

Our API will have two methods: 
1. 'hello' which will return the text 'Hello Endpoints'.
2. 'reverse' which will take a given string and reverse it. 

###Assumptions
This tutorial is designed to get you up and running with your first Google Cloud Endpoints API. Thus, while we will try to go slowly through each and every stage in the process, this is not a general Google Cloud Platform (GCP) or Google Container Enginer (GKE) tutorial. If you need help getting set up with GCP, please read the official getting started guides.
